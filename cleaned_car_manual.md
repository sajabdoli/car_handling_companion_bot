## **Navigation system (12.3-**

**inch display model)**
The navigation system is one of
the most technologically
advanced vehicle accessories
ever developed. The system
receives satellite signals from
the Global Positioning System
(GPS) operated by the U.S.
Department of Defense. Using
these signals and other vehicle
sensors, the system indicates
your present position and
assists in locating a desired destination.
The navigation system is
designed to select efficient
routes from your present starting location to your destination.
The system is also designed to
direct you to a destination that is
unfamiliar to you in an efficient
manner. The system uses AISIN
AW maps. The calculated
routes may not be the shortest
nor the least traffic congested.
Your own personal local knowledge or “short cut” may at times
be faster than the calculated
routes.
The navigation system’s database includes Point of Interest
categories to allow you to easily
select destinations such as
restaurants and hotels. If a destination is not in the database

This manual explains the operation of the system. Please read
this manual carefully to ensure
proper use. Keep this manual in
your vehicle at all times.
The screens shown in this manual may differ from the actual
screen of the system depending
on availability of functions, connected services subscription
status, and map data available
at the time this manual was produced.
The screens in this manual will
also differ if the screen theme
settings have been changed.
(Theme setting: P.65)
In some situations when changing between screens, it may
take longer than normal for the
screen to change, the screen
may be blank momentarily or
noise may be displayed.

close to it and the system will
guide you there.
The system will provide both a
visual map and audio instructions. The audio instructions will
announce the distance remaining and the direction to turn in
when approaching an intersection. These voice instructions
will help you keep your eyes on
the road and are timed to provide enough time to allow you to
maneuver, change lanes or slow
down.
Please be aware that all current
vehicle navigation systems have
certain limitations that may
affect their ability to perform
properly. The accuracy of the
vehicle’s position depends on
satellite conditions, road configuration, vehicle condition or
other circumstances. For more
information on the limitations of
the system, refer to page 121.

**rate position may not be**
**shown depending on satel-**

## The GPS signal may be physically obstructed, leading to inaccurate vehicle position on the

map screen. Tunnels, tall buildings, trucks, or even the placement of objects on the
instrument panel may obstruct
the GPS signals.
The GPS satellites may not
send signals due to repairs or
improvements being made to
them.

## Even when the navigation system is receiving clear GPS signals, the vehicle position may

not be shown accurately or inappropriate route guidance may
occur in some cases.
NOTICE

## **Limitations of the naviga-**

**tion system**
The Global Positioning System
(GPS) developed and operated
by the U.S. Department of
Defense provides an accurate
current position, normally using
4 or more satellites, and in some
case 3 satellites. The GPS system has a certain level of inaccuracy. While the navigation
system compensates for this
most of the time, occasional
positioning errors of up to 300 ft.
(100 m) can and should be
expected. Generally, position
errors will be corrected within a
few seconds.

## -  The installation of window tinting may obstruct the GPS signals. Most window tinting

contains some metallic content
that will interfere with GPS signal reception of the antenna in
the instrument panel. We advise
against the use of window tinting on vehicles equipped with
navigation systems.
 Accurate current position may
not be shown in the following
cases:

## -  When driving on a small angled

Y-shaped road.
-  When driving on a winding road.
-  When driving on a slippery road
such as in sand, gravel, snow,
etc

## When the vehicle is not receiving signals from satellites, the

unreceived GPS mark appears
on the map screen. When the
vehicle is receiving the signals,

-  When freeway and surface
streets run in parallel.
-  After moving by ferry or vehicle

-  After repeating a change of direction by going forward and backward, or turning on a turntable in

-  When leaving a covered parking
lot or parking garage.
-  When a roof carrier is installed.
-  When driving with tire chains

-  When the tires are worn.
-  After replacing a tire or tires.
-  When using tires that are smaller
or larger than the factory specifications.
-  When the tire pressure in any of
the 4 tires is not correct.
 If the vehicle cannot receive
GPS signals, the current position can be adjusted manually. For information on setting
the current position calibration: P.114
 Inappropriate route guidance
may occur in the following
cases:
-  When turning at an intersection
off the designated route guid

Once outside this range, you
may notice fading and drifting,
which increase with the distance
from the radio transmitter. They
are often accompanied by distortion.
Multi-path: FM signals are
reflective, making it possible for
2 signals to reach the vehicle’s
antenna at the same time. If this
happens, the signals will cancel
each other out, causing a
momentary flutter or loss of
reception.
Static and fluttering: These
occur when signals are blocked
by buildings, trees or other large
objects. Increasing the bass
level may reduce static and fluttering.
Station swapping: If the FM signal being listened to is interrupted or weakened, and there
is another strong station nearby
on the FM band, the radio may
tune in the second station until
the original signal can be picked
up again.
■ **AM**

## -  The use of a cellular phone inside

or near the vehicle may cause a
noise from the speakers of the
audio/visual system which you are
listening to. However, this does
not indicate a malfunction.
NOTICE

## -  To avoid damage to the

audio/visual system, be careful
not to spill beverages over the
audio/visual system.
**Radio**

## Usually, a problem with radio

reception does not mean there
is a problem with the radio  it
is just the normal result of conditions outside the vehicle.
For example, nearby buildings
and terrain can interfere with FM
reception. Power lines or phone
wires can interfere with AM signals. And of course, radio signals have a limited range. The
farther the vehicle is from a station, the weaker its signal will
be. In addition, reception conditions change constantly as the
vehicle moves.
Here, some common reception
problems that probably do not
indicate a problem with the radio
are described.
■ **FM**

## Fading: AM broadcasts are

reflected by the upper atmosphere  especially at night.
These reflected signals can
interfere with those received
directly from the radio station,
causing the radio station to
sound alternately strong and

## Fading and drifting stations:



## -----

reflected signal and a signal
received directly from a radio
station are very nearly the same
frequency, they can interfere
with each other, making it difficult to hear the broadcast.
Static: AM is easily affected by
external sources of electrical
noise, such as high tension
power lines, lightening or electrical motors. This results in static.

-  The screen illustrations used in
this text are intended as examples, and may differ from the
image that is actually displayed on

**Driving precautions**
The parking assist monitor is a
supplemental device intended to
assist the driver when backing
up. When backing up, be sure to
visually check all around the
vehicle both directly and using
the mirrors before proceeding. If
you do not, you may hit another
vehicle, and could possibly
cause an accident.
Pay attention to the following
precautions when using the
parking assist monitor.

## -  Never depend on the parking

assist monitor entirely when
backing up. The image and the
position of the guide lines displayed on the screen may differ
from the actual state.
Use caution, just as you would
when backing up any vehicle.
-  Be sure to back up slowly,
depressing the brake pedal to
control vehicle speed.
-  If you seem likely to hit nearby
vehicles, obstacles, people or
mount the shoulder, depress
the brake pedal to stop the vehicle.
-  The instructions given are only
guidelines. When and how
much to turn the steering wheel
will vary according to traffic conditions, road surface conditions, vehicle condition, etc.
when parking. It is necessary to
be fully aware of this before
using the parking assist system.
-  When parking, be sure to check
that the parking space will
accommodate your vehicle
before maneuvering into it.
-  Do not use the parking assist
monitor in the following cases:
-  On icy or slick road surfaces, or
in snow
-  When using tire chains or emergency tires

bly cause an accident.
Pay attention to the following
precautions when using the
panoramic view monitor.
**WARNING**
-  Never depend on the panoramic
view monitor entirely. The
image and the position of the
guide lines displayed on the
screen may differ from the
actual state. Use caution just as
you would when driving any
other vehicle.
-  Always make sure to check all
around the vehicle with your
own eyes when driving.
-  Never drive while looking only at
the screen as the image on the
screen is different from actual
conditions. If you are driving
while looking only at the screen,
you may hit a person or an
object, resulting in an accident.
When driving, be sure to check
the vehicle’s surroundings with
your own eyes and the vehicle’s
mirrors.
-  Depending on the circumstances of the vehicle (number
of passengers, amount of luggage, etc.), the position of the
guide lines displayed on the
screen may change. Be sure to
check visually around the vehicle before proceeding.

be sure to visually check all
around the vehicle both directly
and using the mirrors before

## -----

-  Do not use the panoramic view
monitor system in the following
cases:
-  On icy or slick road surfaces, or
in snow
-  When using tire chains or emergency tires
-  When the front door or the back
door is not closed completely
-  On roads that are not flat or
straight, such as curves or
slopes
-  If the suspension has been
modified or tires of a size other
than specified are installed
-  In low temperatures, the screen
may darken or the image may

## -  In panoramic view/moving

view/see-through view/Side
Clearance View/Cornering
View, the system combines
images taken from the front,
back, left and right side cameras into a single image. There
are limits to the range and content that can be displayed.
Familiarize yourself with the
characteristics of the panoramic view monitor system
before using it.
-  Image clarity may decline at the
four corners of the panoramic
view/moving view/see-through
view/Side Clearance View/Cornering View. However, this is
not a malfunction, as these are
the regions along the border of
each camera image where the
images are combined.
-  Depending on lighting conditions near each of the cameras,
bright and dark patches may
appear on the panoramic
view/moving view/see-through
view/Side Clearance View/Cornering View.
-  The panoramic view/moving
view/see-through view/Side
Clearance View/Cornering View
display does not extend higher
than the installation position and
image capture range of each
camera.
-  There are blind spots around
the vehicle. Accordingly, there
are regions not displayed in
panoramic view/moving
view/see-through view/Side
Clearance View/Cornering
View.

## -----

-  Three-dimensional objects displayed in wide front view, rear
view or side view may not be
displayed in panoramic
view/moving view/see-through
view/Side Clearance View/Cornering View.
-  People and other three-dimensional obstacles may appear
differently when displayed on
the panoramic view monitor.
(These differences include,
among others, cases in which
displayed objects appear to
have fallen over, disappear near
image processing areas, appear
from image processing areas,
or when the actual distance to
an object differs from the displayed position.)
-  When the back door, which is
equipped with the back camera,
or front doors, which are
equipped with door mirrors that
have built-in side cameras, are
open, images will not be displayed properly on the panoramic view monitor.
-  The vehicle icon displayed in
panoramic view/moving
view/see-through view/Side
Clearance View/Cornering View
is a computer generated image.
Accordingly, properties such as
the color, shape and size will
differ from the actual vehicle.
For this reason, nearby threedimensional objects may
appear to be touching the vehicle, and actual distances to
three-dimensional objects may
differ from those displayed.

**Area displayed on screen**
**Area of image of panoramic view**
The panoramic view monitor displays an image of the surrounding
view of the vehicle.
Since the panoramic view processes and displays images based on
flat road surfaces, it cannot depict the position of three-dimension
objects (such as vehicle bumpers, etc.) that are in positions higher
than the surface of the road. Even if there is room between the bumpers of the vehicles and it seems not likely to collide in the image, in
reality, the both vehicles are on a collision course.
Check the safety of the surroundings directly.
**A** Objects located in the shaded areas will not be displayed on the
screen.

## -----

**A** Parts of objects which extend above a certain height cannot be
displayed on the screen.
-  As the images obtained from four cameras are processed and displayed
on the standard of a flat road surface; the panoramic view/moving
view/see-through view/Side Clearance View/Cornering View may be displayed as follows.
-  Objects may look collapsed; thinner or bigger than usual.
-  An object with a higher position than the road surface may look farther
away than it actually is or may not appear at all.
-  Tall objects may appear protruding from the non-displayed areas of the
image.

## -  Variations in the brightness of the image may appear for every camera.

-  The displayed image may be shifted by inclination of the vehicle body,
change in vehicle height, etc., depending on the number of passengers,
amount of luggage, fuel quantity, etc.
-  If the front doors or back door are not completely closed; neither the
image nor the guide lines are displayed.

## -  The position relations of the vehicle icon and the road surface or obstacle

may differ from the actual positions.
-  The black areas of the vicinity of the vehicle icon are areas that are not
captured by the camera.

## -  Images like the following are combined, thus some areas may be difficult

to view.

on the screen.
- The area displayed on the screen
may vary depending on vehicle
orientation or road conditions.
-  The camera uses a special lens.
The distance in the image displayed on the screen will differ
from the actual distance.

## **Using the camera**

If dirt or foreign matter (such as
water droplets, snow, mud, etc.)
is adhering to the camera, it
cannot transmit a clear image.
In this case, flush it with a large
quantity of water and wipe the
camera lens clean with a soft

“OWNER’S MANUAL”.
 When cleaning the camera, it
may be difficult to see the
image due to the washer fluid.
When backing up, be sure to
visually check all around the
vehicle both directly and using
the mirrors before proceeding.
 If washer fluid remains on the
camera lens surface after
cleaning, the image may be
difficult to see at night due to
the height or inclination of the
headlights of the vehicle
behind.
 Some dirts may not be
removed completely after
cleaning. In this case, rinse
the camera lens with a large
quantity of water and then
wipe it clean with a soft cloth
dampened with water.
 Washer fluid is sprayed onto
the camera lens surface.
Therefore, the ice, snow, etc.
adhering around the camera
cannot be removed.
NOTICE
-  Do not strike or hit the washer
nozzle or subject it to a strong
impact, as the washer nozzle
installation position and angle
may be changed.

## -  The panoramic view monitor

may not operate properly in the
following cases.
-  If the camera is hit, the position
and mounting angle of the camera may change.
-  As the camera has a water
proof construction, do not
detach, disassemble or modify
it. This may cause incorrect
operation.
-  When cleaning the camera lens,
flush the camera with a large
quantity of water and wipe it
with a soft and wet cloth.
Strongly rubbing the camera
lens may cause the camera lens
to be scratched and unable to
transmit a clear image.
-  Do not allow an organic solvent,
car wax, window cleaner or a
glass coating to adhere to the
camera. If this happens, wipe it
off as soon as possible.
-  If the temperature changes rapidly, such as when hot water is
poured on the vehicle in cold
weather, the system may not
operate normally.
-  When washing the vehicle, do
not apply intensive bursts of
water to the camera or camera
area. Doing so may result in the
camera malfunctioning.
-  Do not expose the camera to
strong impacts as this could
cause a malfunction. If this happens, have the vehicle
inspected by your Toyota dealer
as soon as possible.
