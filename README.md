# Car manual assitant, Work in progress!

This repo contains a notebook, a simple use case of [Llama assistant model](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct)nfor answering questions related to car handling. 
This is a simple [Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/), aka RAG model, that extracts related parts from the manual for a clear, validated answer by the assistant.

In this use case, we use the manual document of the Toyota Verena car available in this file: The document is created by converting the .pdf to a text file.
